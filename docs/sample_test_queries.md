## Testing Guidelines

### Query Classification Testing

When testing query classification, verify that:
- Each query is correctly classified into the expected category
- The workflow type matches the category requirements
- The appropriate agents are selected for the workflow

### Agent Workflow Testing

For agent workflows, verify:
- **Single Agent Workflows:** Only the expected agent is called
- **Multi-Agent Workflows:** All required agents are called in the correct order
- **Full Workflows:** Complete agent pipeline executes (analysts → researchers → managers → risk assessment)

### Response Quality Testing

Evaluate responses for:
- Accuracy of information provided
- Completeness of analysis
- Relevance to the query
- Proper formatting (especially for reports with markdown tables)
- Appropriate use of tools and data sources

### Edge Cases

Test with:
- Ambiguous queries that could match multiple categories
- Queries with typos or incomplete information
- Queries about non-existent companies
- Queries with date ranges
- Queries with multiple tickers
- Follow-up questions that require context

---

## Notes

- **Ticker Symbols:** Use standard ticker symbols (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT) for best results
- **Date Context:** Some queries may benefit from specifying dates (e.g., "as of 2024-01-15")
- **Company Names:** The system accepts both company names and ticker symbols
- **Context Awareness:** In multi-turn conversations, the system maintains context from previous messages
- **Workflow Selection:** The system automatically selects the appropriate workflow based on query intent
